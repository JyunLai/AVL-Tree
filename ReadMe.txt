Build an AVL tree, that allows insertion and deletion.
INPUT:
The first line is a list of numbers, build an AVL tree by inserting the numbers in order.
The following lines are the operations, each operation starts from I (Insertion) or D (Deletion), and ends with a value.
(ex. D 27 -> Delete the node in the AVL tree whose value is 27)
OUTPUT:
The first row is the Inorder traversal of the AVL tree after all the operations.
The second row is the total number of rotations.
The last row records which method is used when rotations occur (ex. LL, LR, LR, RL, R0, R1, R-1).
